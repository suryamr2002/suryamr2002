## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Data Scientist** at **Kovai.co** with 2+ years of experience building **production ML systems** that solve real business problems. I don't just train models—I ship them to production, monitor them, and measure their impact.

**What I've Built:**
- 🤖 **RAG Chatbot** → Reduced support tickets by **46%** and saved **$150K/year** (89% accuracy)
- 🎯 **PQL Scoring System** → Transformed messy product logs into revenue predictions using MLflow
- 📊 **Recommendation Engine** → Achieved **12% engagement lift** through hybrid filtering
- 🔮 **Churn Prediction Model** → Enabled proactive retention strategies with XGBoost

**My Superpower:** Translating business problems into ML solutions that stakeholders actually use.

## 💼 What I'm Working On

🔭 **Currently:** Building production-grade LLM applications (RAG, vector search, agentic workflows)  
🌱 **Learning:** Advanced MLOps patterns, causal inference, multi-cloud deployment  
💡 **Exploring:** Model Context Protocol (MCP), AutoGen frameworks
